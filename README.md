# GoGetIt
A web-app project based on the concept of web scrapping with PHP for back-end service, HTML for front-end service and CSS, Bootstrap, JS and AJAX as scripting languages. This project is essentially targeted on 'justdial.com'.
For web-scrapping, the project uses simple-dom-html.php for extracting information from the specified webpage using their URLs which are generated with the help of inputs taken from the user.
Inputs taken include the name of the generic or specific place user wants to find,region/city of search and an optional input of nearest landmark.
The specified input generates a table containing names, addresses, phone numbers and links to Google Maps pointing the location of the searched location.
